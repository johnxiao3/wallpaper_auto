# Scheduling a Python Script Every 2 Minutes on macOS

This guide explains how to schedule a Python script to run every 2 minutes on a Mac using `cron`, with the Python script made executable.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Python Script

1. Add a shebang line at the very top of your Python script:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```

2. Make the script executable by running:

    ```bash
    chmod +x /full/path/to/your_script.py
    ```

---

## Step 2: Verify Python Interpreter Path (Optional)

To check the Python 3 interpreter path, run:

```bash
which python3
````

Typical output:

```
/usr/bin/python3
```

---

## Step 3: Edit the Cron Table

Open your crontab editor:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run your script every 2 minutes:

```cron
*/2 * * * * /full/path/to/your_script.py
```

**Notes:**

* `*/2` in the minutes field means "every 2 minutes".
* Use the **absolute path** for your script.
* Since your script is executable and has the shebang line, you don’t need to call `python3` explicitly.

---

## Step 4: Save and Exit

* In `nano`, press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.
* Your cron job is now scheduled.

---

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Tips

* Test your script manually to ensure it works:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/your_script.py
  ```

* To capture logs and errors, modify the cron entry to redirect output:

  ```cron
  */2 * * * * /full/path/to/your_script.py >> /tmp/myscript.log 2>&1
  ```

* Check system logs for cron activity:

  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/system.log
  ```
